# TTCSM_NPS
Travel time cost surface model migrated from python 2.x to 3.9 to be ran within ArcGIS Pro
This model is to be used by NPS staff to minimize travel time to field locations. 
The model recieves a DEM and landcover layer, as well as feature layers of roads, tralis, streams etc. 
The travel speed assoicated with layers determines the least cost path output between given destinations and starting points.
